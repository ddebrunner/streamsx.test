# streamsx.test

Utilities to allow testing of IBM Streams applications, toolkits, operators and functions.

## Application testing

* To be added.

## Java Mock Operator Framework

The mock framework allows unit testing of Java primitive operators using standard Java unit test frameworks such as [JUnit](http://junit.org/junit4/).

The mock framework is part of the IBM Streams product.

Samples of it use are provided in the Java package `com.ibm.streamsx.test.samples.javaprimitives.tests` with source code under [samples/java/src](samples/java/src/com/ibm/streamsx/test/samples/javaprimitives). JUnit 4 is used as the test framework.
